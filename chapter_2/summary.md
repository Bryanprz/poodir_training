  # Important points

* Keep new code simple.
  * Don't try to get perfect code from the start.
  * "Design is more the art of preserving changeability than it is the act of achieving perfection."

* To make code easy to change each class should have *one* well-defined responsibilty.
  * What nouns are being used to describe your app?
    * These nouns are candidates for potential classes.
    * Nouns that have behavior and data deserve to be a class.

* Classes and methods should have a single responsibility (SRP - Single Responsibility Principle).
  * If your class is a person, ask him about his methods and it should all make sense. 
  * Ask your class what it does, you should be able to answer it in one sentence without using 'and'.
