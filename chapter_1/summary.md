# Chapter 1

* Procedural vs. Object-Oriented
  * A procedural world is defined by step-by-step processes. 
    * Think of a cooking recipe that reads from top down. The only events that occur are what's listed in the recipe.
    * In this linear world everything happens because it's already been defined from start to finish.

  * An object-oriented world is defined by a series of messages that pass between objects. 
    * This resembles the real world where independent objects interact with each other.
    * Objects can interact with other objects which can lead to new and unexpected results.

  * "Object-oriented design (OOD) requires that you shift from thinking of the world as a collection of predefined procedures to modeling the world as a series of messages that pass between objects." - Metz, page 1

* Procedural mindset
  * Thinking of a program as step-by-step instructions the computer needs to do.

* OO mindset
  * Thinking of a program as a world where objects have their own actions.

* The problem design solves
  * Design is meant to reduce the cost of change.
  * In software something will always change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Why change is hard
  * For objects to interact with each other, they need to know about each other.
  * This knowledge of other objects creates dependencies.
  * Dependencies stand in the way of chanage.
  * "Object-oriented design is about *managing dependencies.*" - Metz, page 3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* A practical definition of design
  * "Design is thus an art, the art of arranging code" - Metz, page 4
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* How design fails
  * Lack of design.
  * Overdesign - designing for features too far in the future.
  * When the programmer is not the individual designing the code.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Judging design
  * Don't judge design based on number of lines of code written.
  * The only metric that matters is "*cost per feature over the time interval that matters.*"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Brief intro to OO programming
  * OO apps are made of objects and the messages passed between them.
  * Of the two, messages are more important that objects.
  * "Ruby combines data and behavior into a single thing, an object." - Metz, page 12
